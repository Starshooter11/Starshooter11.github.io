# Coding Projects
## Python
**Hog** - A dice game where two players compete to achieve a score of 100. Every turn, a player can choose to roll up to 10 dice. Their score is dependent on both the rolls' results and the different events that can trigger based on rolled values. I also developed a bot that can play against the player, utilizing strategies based on expected value and risk of a roll.

**CATS** - Short for Computer-Aided Typing Software, this program measures typing speed and autocorrects any misspelled words based on the lowest amount of differences ebtween the typed word and possible correct words. There is also a multi-player feature with live updates to a public scoreboard.

**Ants** - A rendition of plants vs. zombies, utilizing object-oriented programming paradigms to check for, attack, and defend against enemies.


## Java
**LinkedList and ArrayList Deques** - Implemented my own classes with fully functional methods.

**Ngordnet** - A browser based tool that explores the history of word usage in English texts. Utilizes a hashmap to contain data and allow for quick searching, as well as a hyponyms hndler to display the relations between words.

**Dungeon Crawler** - A 2D game with 5 pseudorandomly generated floors. Each floor contains multiple rooms fit on a square grid. Both the floors and the average room size increase as the player progresses through the floors. Each room spawns a certain number of mobs based on room size who track down the player. The player has two attack abilities that differ in attack power and stun demerit from usage. Killing more mobs nets points for the player that is displayed in the corner. The game also features a player-following camera and floor-based music. The player can also choose to save their progress and exit the game at any time.  

## C
**snek** - A rendition of the popular snake game on Google

**KaChow** - A program that convolves matrices of images from videos to achieve a Gaussian blur effect. It utilizies SIMD and OpenMP to speed up processing through the use of vectors and parallel processing.

**PintOS** - A four-person group project aimed at developing and improving PintOS, an educational operating system. We iimplemented multi-threading, multi-processing, argument passing, file control syscalls, process control syscalls, a strict priority scheduler, an LRU 64-block write-back buffer cache, and rigorous synchronization.

## RISC-V
**Classify** - Classifies handwritten digits using a simplified machine learning algorithm to analyze data.

## Logism
**CPU** - Using the interface, I built a working CPU that can run RISC-V instructions

## "C# in Unity"
**Spaceship!** - A 2D upwards-scrolling game where the player controls a spaceship. The spaceship is omnidirectional and features physics-based movement. It also has a health and fuel bar. As the player flies through the sky, different obstacles will appear that either affect the player's visibility or decrease their spaceship's health and/or fuel bar. As the fuel depletes, the player must land on randomly spawning refuelling islands that allow the player to rest momentarily. Should they stay for too long, they will automatically lose. Points are calculated based on vertical distance travelled and the game keeps track of the player's highest score. Co-developed in a two-person team.

**Aperture** - A 2D visual novel-esque game with cutscenes and dynamic choices that can drastically change the ending. As part of the 4 person team working on this game, I developed the storyteller overlay and the binary tree-based decision tree. The overlay features the traditional visual novel style of storytelling with words appearing per character, a floating triangle indicating that the player should click to continue the story, the changing opacity of the speaking characters, and dynamic lighting. The decision tree allows for two choices which affect the story in many ways. Some choices lead to different endings while others do not affect the overall storyline. I also implemented the opening cutscenes, activated by the player walking down a hallway, as well as the first major scene.
